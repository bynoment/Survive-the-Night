Survive the Night is an intense, strategy based first person gamemode where Factions fight to survive the night!


## Gameplay

Night / Judgement Cycle - The main mechanic of the flow of the game, the time cycle. During the night players 
will attempt to complete faction missions by performing their job-specific missions. After each night of the game,
players are sent to judgement where they choose one person to go up and be executed!

Factions & Classes - The main mechanic for the actual gameplay of the gamemode! Each player is assigned a random 
faction and class at the beginning of every round! The faction is the main team and each class is a job under the 
faction. Each faction and class are in the config file and are modifiable, meaning server owners can create new 
factions and classes!

Weapons - The types of weapons a class can have are: melee, ranged, tool, and fists. All players start with fists and 
certain jobs are given different weapons!

Death Notes / Calling Cards - All players can write a death note or calling card to be read during the next judgement 
session after their death. Death cards are made to allow players to log progress on figuring out who is what class!
Calling cards are read when the victim of the killer is revealed at judgement.
