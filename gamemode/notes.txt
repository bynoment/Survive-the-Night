your first bit of lua! Lua is a beautifully crafted scripted language adapted to Garry's Mod that allows ANYONE (even you!) to
create completely new and amazing addons to the game! This entire gamemode was created in lua! So if creating gamemodes,
addons, vehicles, weapons, entities, and just being a general bad ass is something you seek, then start learning today!
It's totally free! Ill even help get you started :)
